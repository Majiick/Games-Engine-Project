# Games-Engine-Project

# Concept
The idea for this project is to procedurally generate a village and the roads within a village. The village will be generated using an ontonogenic approach using perlin noise and will have food sources, water, trees and one village.

The roads will be generated using a teleological approach using simulating villager agents.

The villagers will collect resources for their needs in order to advance the village and maybe build some structures. While they are doing this, the ground they walk on becomes more and more walkable as the villagers tread on the grass. Soon this will create paths and roads that the villagers will use and this is how the roads are generated.

I also asked Reddit about this and they suggested using ant colony algorithms: https://www.reddit.com/r/proceduralgeneration/comments/9lvd6e/generating_villages_using_villager_simulation/
